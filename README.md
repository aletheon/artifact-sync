# Artifact Sync

**Artifact Sync** is a Chrome Extension designed to automatically capture and archive the creative outputs ("artifacts") from your AI coding sessions. It listens to conversations on supported AI platforms and saves prompts, responses, attachments, and visual artifacts (like images or diagrams) directly to your **Google Drive** or **Local File System**.

## 🚀 Features

*   **Automatic Archiving**: Saves every turn of your conversation (user prompt + AI response) as it happens.
*   **Multi-Provider Support**: Currently supports **Google Gemini** and **ChatGPT**.
*   **Artifact Capture**: Automatically scrapes and saves images generated by the AI (e.g., diagrams, generated UI mockups).
*   **Flexible Storage**:
    *   **Google Drive**: Saves organized folders for each conversation directly to your Drive.
    *   **Local Download**: Uses the browser's download manager to save files locally.
*   **Format Options**: Save conversations as Markdown (`.md`) or PDF (`.pdf`).

## ⚠️ Limitations

*   **Browser Dependency**: The extension relies on the DOM structure of the AI provider's web interface. If Gemini or ChatGPT significantly changes their HTML layout, the scraper may break until updated.
*   **Local File Organization**: When using the "Local" storage method with the default "Downloads" strategy, the extension is limited by Chrome's download API. It creates subfolders within your default Downloads directory but cannot write outside of it.
*   **PDF Generation**: PDF generation is done client-side and may struggle with extremely long conversations or complex layouts.

### 🛑 Deprecated Support: Claude.ai

We attempted to support **Anthropic's Claude**, but it has been currently removed due to technical instability. 

**The Problem:**
Claude's interface for rendering artifacts (like React previews or images) uses a complex loading mechanism that made it difficult to reliably capture the *final* state of an artifact. 

During our tests, we encountered a persistent "race condition" where the extension would capture the artifact image before it had finished updating. This resulted in "stale" saves—where a user would ask for a red square, the code would update, but the saved image would still be the previous blue circle. Despite implementing advanced `MutationObserver` logic and "settling timers" to wait for DOM stability, the image capture remained misaligned with the text content. 

Until a more reliable method for detecting Claude's internal "render complete" state is found, support has been disabled to prevent data corruption.
